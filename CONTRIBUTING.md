# Contributing to LazyMD

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LazyMD!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lazymd.git`
3. Install [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) 0.15.1+

## Development Workflow

```bash
zig build          # Build
zig build run      # Run the editor
zig build test     # Run all tests
zig fmt src/       # Format code
```

## Making Changes

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure tests pass: `zig build test`
4. Ensure code is formatted: `zig fmt src/`
5. Commit with a clear message
6. Push and open a pull request

## Code Style

- Follow Zig standard conventions
- Use `zig fmt` for formatting (enforced by CI)
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add tests for new functionality
