# LazyMD Roadmap

## What's Shipped

### Editor Core

- Rendered markdown preview with ASCII styling
- Gap buffer with full undo/redo stack
- Double-buffered rendering with diff-based updates
- Mouse support (click to position, scroll, panel switching)
- Syntax highlighting for 16+ languages
- 12 built-in color themes (Dracula, Gruvbox, Nord, Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, etc.)
- `.rndm` file format (100% backward compatible with `.md`)
- Zero external dependencies (pure Zig, POSIX termios + ANSI escape codes)

- Document tools: `open_file`, `read_document`, `write_document`, `list_headings`, `edit_section`, `insert_text`, `delete_lines`, `search_content`, `get_structure`
- Navigation tools: `read_section`, `list_tasks`, `update_task`, `get_breadcrumb`, `move_section`, `read_section_range`
- Brain tools: `list_links`, `get_backlinks`, `get_graph`, `get_neighbors`, `find_path`, `get_orphans`, `get_hub_notes`
- Works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and any MCP-compatible client

### Brain (Knowledge Graph)
- `[[wiki-link]]` scanning across vaults
- Backlink discovery
